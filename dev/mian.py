"""
Acts as the central coordinator. This node will:
  Receive the current board state from the vision system.
  Convert the visual input into a FEN string.
  Send the FEN to the chess engine and get the best move.
  Translate the chess move into commands for the arm control system (including safe positioning, e.g., high,
  low, backup, and ensuring a safety gap between the piece and board).
  Command the gripper (Robotic Hand E) to open/close and include logic for reinitialization if it shuts off.
  Integrate an emergency stop mechanism.
